# Healthcare Analytics: Heart Disease Risk Factor Analysis

## Overview
This project conducts an exploratory data analysis of a heart disease dataset to examine demographic and clinical factors associated with cardiovascular disease risk. The analysis is from a healthcare analytics perspective with focus on careful interpretation and clinical relevance.

## Objectives
- Explore patient demographic and proxies to physiological variables related to heart disease
- Identify patterns and associations that may inform further statistical modeling
- Determine if there is a difference in clinical utility of comparative population survey metrics.

## Dataset Description
The dataset contains anonymized patient records with a mix of:
- Demographic variables (e.g., age, sex)
- responses to questions that are treated as a proxy to outcome indicators related to heart disease presence.

## Methods
- Data cleaning and validation
- Exploratory data analysis
- Visualization of trends and subgroup differences
- Interpretation of clinically relevant patterns
- Application of Linear Regression with Cross Validation
