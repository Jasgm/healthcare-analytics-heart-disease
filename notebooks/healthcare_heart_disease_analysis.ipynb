    "\n",
    "This analysis evaluates whether self-reported health and lifestyle indicators provide incremental value beyond basic demographics for discriminating prior heart attack status using BRFSS survey data. Logistic regression models were evaluated using stratified cross-validation, with performance assessed primarily via ROC-AUC and secondarily via precision–recall AUC to account for class imbalance. A baseline model using age and sex achieved moderate discriminative performance (ROC-AUC ≈ 0.75). Incorporating Life’s Essential 8 proxy variables resulted in a consistent improvement in discrimination (ROC-AUC ≈ 0.79; Δ ≈ +0.04), with corresponding gains in precision–recall performance. Holdout evaluation produced comparable results, supporting the stability of the cross-validated estimates. Overall, findings indicate that self-reported survey data contain meaningful incremental signal for population-level discrimination of heart attack status, though predictive precision remains limited by outcome prevalence.\n",

    "## Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "Cardiovascular disease risk has been extensively studied using clinical and physiological measurements. However, many large-scale population datasets rely primarily on self-reported health indicators and behaviors rather than direct clinical measurements. The utility of these self-reported indicators for predictive modeling of cardiovascular outcomes remains an important practical question for population health analytics.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objective\n",
    "The objective of this study is to evaluate the extent to which self-reported health indicators, behavioral factors, and demographic characteristics from two different feature subsets can be used to predict a history of myocardial infarction in a population-based survey dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Scope and Limitations\n",
    "Because the dataset relies on self-reported measures and does not include direct physiological measurements such as blood pressure, conclusions are limited to the utility of observable, non-invasive indicators for population-level risk modeling."
